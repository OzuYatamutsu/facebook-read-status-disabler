# Facebook Sneekycate

This userscript blocks all POSTS to `change_read_status.php`, `delivery_receipts.php`, and `typ.php`. As a result, other people on Facebook chat will not be able to see when you are typing or when you've opened a message.

This is a fork of Lo√Øs Di Qual's original userscript [here](https://github.com/ldiqual/facebook-read-status-disabler), adding an additional typing block and blocking POSTs to the new `delivery_receipts.php`. All credit to him! :3

# Installation

This is a userscript, so it requires [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) on Firefox or [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) on Chrome. 

Once you've installed one of those addons, install this script by going [here](https://github.com/OzuYatamutsu/facebook-read-status-disabler/raw/master/facebook-read-status-disabler.user.js).
